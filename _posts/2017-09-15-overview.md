# Required Readings

## 1. Overview


## 2. Speeding Reading

Written language is a technology people have developed to communicate ideas. What are the cognitive limits to the process of reading? Can they be expanded with new technology?

## 3. Brain Training

Numerous websites and apps claim that users can enhance their cognitive skills by playing brain games. What does the data say?

  - Simons, D. J., Boot, W. R., Charness, N., Gathercole, S. E., Chabris, C. F., Hambrick, D. Z., & Stine-Morrow, E. A. L. (2016). Do “Brain-Training” Programs Work? *Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 17,* 103–186.

## 4. Appifying Education

How are cognitive principles and new tech being used to create *improved* educational resources and experiences?
