# Required Readings

## 1. Overview


## 2. Speeding Reading

Written language is a technology people have developed to communicate ideas. What are the cognitive limits to the process of reading? Can they be expanded with new technology?

  - Rayner, K., Schotter, E. R., Masson, M. E., Potter, M. C., & Treiman, R. (2016). So Much to Read, So Little Time How Do We Read, and Can Speed Reading Help? *Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 17,* 4–34.

  - Balota, D. A. (2016). Speed Reading: You Can’t Always Get What You Want, but Can You Sometimes Get What You Need? *Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 17,* 1–3.

  - Benedetto, S., Carbone, A., Pedrotti, M., Le Fevre, K., Bey, L. A. Y., & Baccino, T. (2015). Rapid serial visual presentation in reading: The case of Spritz. *Computers in Human Behavior, 45,* 352–358.

## 3. Brain Training

Numerous websites and apps claim that users can enhance their cognitive skills by playing brain games. What does the data say?

  - Simons, D. J., Boot, W. R., Charness, N., Gathercole, S. E., Chabris, C. F., Hambrick, D. Z., & Stine-Morrow, E. A. L. (2016). Do “Brain-Training” Programs Work? *Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 17,* 103–186.

  - McCabe, J. A., Redick, T. S., & Engle, R. W. (2016). Brain-Training Pessimism, but Applied-Memory Optimism. *Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 17,* 187–191.

## 4. Appifying Education

How are cognitive principles and new tech being used to create *improved* educational resources and experiences?

  - Dunlosky, J., Rawson, K. A., Marsh, E. J., Nathan, M. J., & Willingham, D. T. (2013). Improving Students’ Learning With Effective Learning Techniques: Promising Directions From Cognitive and Educational Psychology. *Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 14,* 4–58.

  - Hirsh-Pasek, K., Zosh, J. M., Golinkoff, R. M., Gray, J. H., Robb, M. B., & Kaufman, J. (2015). Putting Education in “Educational” Apps: Lessons From the Science of Learning. *Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 16,* 3–34.

  - Roediger, H. L. (2013). Applying Cognitive Psychology to Education: Translational Educational Science. *Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 14,* 1–3.

  - Wartella, E. (2015). Educational Apps: What We Do and Do Not Know. *Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 16,* 1–2.

## Detecting Liars

  - Loftus, E. F. (2010). Catching Liars. *Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 11,* 87–88.

  - Vrij, A., Granhag, P. A., & Porter, S. (2010). *Pitfalls and Opportunities in Nonverbal and Verbal Lie Detection. Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 11,* 89–121.

## Augmented Reality

3-D headsets, google glasses, new phones, and more are capable of overlaying computer generated visuals on top of normal world as we see it. Is there any evidence this tech can augment cognition?

## Smart Spaces

The objects and spaces in our lives are increasingly infused with computers and internet connections. What are the opportunities and consequences for cognition?

## Instance Theory

We look at cognitive theories of memory proposing the instance (episodic representation) as a fundamental unit of cognition. This will set the stage for our following discussions of computational techniques for pattern classification that have been applied to solving problems in numerous domains.

## Neural Networks

We do a short primer on neural networks and compuational pattern classification techniques.

## Object Recognition systems

The shazam app can recognize the music you are listening to. Computer algorithms can now classify and identify many kinds of objects, which was a difficulty problem only a number of years ago. We look at some examples.

## Semantic Models

Relatively simple learning models trained on large corpuses of texts (e.g., digitized books) can become sensitive to the semantic meaning of words. These models project words into a geometric space, such that the distance between words represents their semantic similarity. The models offer both a theory of human semantics, and technology for semantics processing and classification.

  - LSA
  - BEAGLE

## Decoding Brain States

The same pattern classification algorithms that can be used to classify faces or other objects, can also be used to classify and decode brain states. We look at a few compelling examples.

  - Early Vision
  - Dreams

## Cognition on drugs

What does the current drug research tell us about enhancing aspects of cognition?

## Big Data

What is the intersection between cognitive research and the growing interest in big data?
