### Catalog Description

2 hours lecture, 3 credits

Basic principles of experimental psychology and experimental methodology. A variety of specific content areas in psychology, including those in social psychology, learning, perception, and cognitive psychology. Laboratory replication of classic experiments from these content areas. Writing intensive course

### Course Objectives

My goal is for you to learn:

1. To read and evaluate psychological literature
2. The basics of scientific methodology in psychology. This will be achieved by working through most of the important steps involved in conducting experimental research
3. How research benefits from being conducted as part of a research team and in the context of a critical community of peers
4.	Whether you may be interested in other courses and programs that involve empirical research
5.	To evaluate claims like those presented in the media (e.g., do video games improve your attention, etc.), and understand the differences between science and pseudoscience

NOTE: The schedule and procedures described in this syllabus are subject to change in the event of extenuating circumstances. You will always be notified of changes both in class AND by posts to the class website. Your enrollment in the course represents your acknowledgment and acceptance of the non-negotiable policies described in the syllabus.

### Additional resources

Supplementary material will be posted on the course website. Lab instructors may recommend a text that specifically outlines the APA format and writing APA style research reports. This course will require use of the web, internet tools, and open-source (free) computing tools available in the lab.

### Course Structure:

## The Lecture

There will be a two hour lecture each week. The lecture covers material that is available in the text book. The course schedule outlines chapters that should be read prior to each lecture. Some lectures will require reading of supplementary material, and access to these materials will be posted online using the course website. The lectures will also cover material that is thematically related to that presented in the textbook. The purpose of the lecture is to cover important concepts in experimental psychology, and prepare you for conducting psychological research in the laboratory. You will be tested on material from the lectures and textbook in two exams: a midterm, and a cumulative final exam.

## Grading (total of 100)

Your final grade combines your performance in the lab and lecture portions of the course. The percentage grade is determined from the following components.

||||
|:--|:--|:--|
|						||Total %|
|Lecture|||
||Assignments & Attendance (lab and lecture)	|		20%|
||Midterm 				|	10%|
||Final exam (cumulative) 		|	25%|
||Extra Credit				|	up to 2% (see below)|
|Lab||
||Paper 1 				|	10%|
||Paper 2 				|10%|
||Paper 3 				|	15%|
||Presentation 1 	|			5%|
||Presentation 2  |				5%|

Percentage grades are converted to letter grades according to the following rubric.

|Letter grade|Range|
|:--|:--|
|F	|0-59.99|
|D-	|60-63.32|
|D	|63.33-66.66|
|D+	|66.67-69.99|
|C-	|70-72.99|
|C	|73-76.66|
|C+	|76.67-79.49|
|B-	|79.5-83.32|
|B	|83.33-86.66|
|B+	|86.67-89.99|
|A-	|90-93.32|
|A	|93.33-96.66|
|A+	|96.67-100|


## Lecture and Lab Assignments and Attendance

The lecture portion will involve weekly assignments that are to be completed electronically on blackboard. Assignments are usually short quizzes (10-20 questions). “Assignments & Attendance” accounts for 20% of the final grade. The 20% is computed from the assignments, but can be decreased as a result of poor attendance. If a student is late or misses more than 3 classes, then each additional late/missed class will result in subtracting 1% from the 20% for Assignments and Attendance.

Lecture attendance is taken every lecture at the very beginning of class. Latecomers who miss attendance will not be allowed to record their attendance, and will be recorded as absent.

The lab portion will involve weekly assignments completed in the lab. Attendance will also be taken in the lab each week. It is absolutely critical that you arrive to labs on time. If you do not arrive on time you will be given a late. If you are late or miss a lab more than three times, then you will be penalized for each additional lateness or absence by 1% of from the 20% for Assignments and Attendance.

If you do have to miss class due to exceptional circumstances, please make arrangements to get notes from a classmate


## University’s policy on Academic Integrity

The faculty and administration of Brooklyn College support an environment free from cheating and plagiarism. As a student, you are personally responsible for being aware of what constitutes cheating, and plagiarism; and, for avoiding both. You can view the complete text of the CUNY Academic Integrity Policy here:
[http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/policies](http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/policies)
If a faculty member suspects a violation of academic integrity, and upon investigation, confirms that violation, or if the student admits the violation, the faculty member MUST report the violation.

## Missing an Exam or class

Make-up exams will be given only when there is a “good” reason for having missed an exam. For example, if a sudden illness causes you to miss an exam, then you should be prepared to provide me with a brief note signed by your physician. Contact me before an exam in the event that you anticipate missing one. In the event of an emergency, contact me as soon as possible. If you are missing a class for religious reasons refer to the state law regarding non-attendance because of religious beliefs (p. 64 in the Undergraduate Bulletin or p. 40 of the Graduate Bulletin).

WARNING: This is not the kind of course for which you do not need to come to class, and read the textbook at the last minute and expect to do well on tests and papers. The material in this course builds in complexity across classes, and doing well in this course will require a constant moderate level of effort. If you join the course later or are unsure about anything please ask.

## Accessibility

It is important to me that the course be accessible to all students. In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations students must first be registered with the Center for Student Disability Services. Students who have a documented disability or suspect they may have a disability are invited to set up an appointment with the Director of the Center for Student Disability Services, Ms. Valerie Stewart-Lovell at 718-951-5538. If you have already registered with the Center for Student Disability Services please provide me with the course accommodation form so we may discuss your specific accommodation. A guide and more information can be found here [http://catsweb.cuny.edu](http://catsweb.cuny.edu)

## Email Correspondence

I will regularly use e-mail to send out announcements, changes in the syllabus, reminders about tests or due dates etc. It is your responsibility to check e-mail regularly to keep up-to-date with these announcements. I will use the e-mail address you have listed with the College. Therefore, please make sure that this is indeed the correct address.
