## Description

2 hours lecture, 3 credits

This seminar course surveys intersections between research and theory in the cognitive sciences and emerging technologies across diverse domains. A general goal is to illustrate how basic research and theory development in cognition has spurred and supported the creation of particular applied technologies. Specific goals include surveying state-of-the art technologies that have applications for augmenting human cognition, as well as considering how emerging technologies create new opportunities for current and future research into cognitive and brain processes.

NOTE: The schedule and procedures described in this syllabus are subject to change in the event of extenuating circumstances. You will always be notified of changes both in class AND by posts to the class website.

## Course Structure:

### The Seminar

There will be a two hour seminar each week. The seminar involves weekly readings and discussions covering a wide variety of cognitive technologies. Typically, each week will involve 1.5 hours for the assigned readings, and .5 hours for student discussion of assigned literature reviews for each week (e.g., students find a paper on the topic and briefly describe it to the class. This allows for a crowd-sourced approach to reviewing the literature.)

### Assignments and Final Paper

Short weekly assignments will be discussed and assigned in class. They generally include 1) being a primary reader for an assigned reading, and 2) contributing to crowd-sourced literature reviews on particular topics.

All students will write a final paper on any area of their choice. These papers will be compiled into a free and open-source book reviewing the area of cognitive technologies. Additional information about the final paper will be provided in class. 

### Grading (total of 100)

The percentage grade is determined from the following components.

## University’s policy on Academic Integrity

CUNY regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g. plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. It is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to its Academic Integrity Procedures.  For the full CUNY policy, please consult:  web.cuny.edu/academics/info-central/policies/academic-integrity.pdf.  

For full guidelines on avoiding and detecting academic honesty, please read the online publication provided by the CUNY Provost’s office (especially SECTION I: FOR THE STUDENT, pp 3-17).  Go to:  [https://www.gc.cuny.edu/About-the-GC/Governance,-Policies,-Procedures/Detail?id=4827](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/About-the-GC/Governance,-Policies,-Procedures/Detail?id=4827) and click on Plagiarism Avoiding and Detecting.  

Be sure you understand what academic dishonesty is so that you do not accidentally commit it. Remember that it is better to over-cite than under-cite.  Whether you intend to be dishonest or not, any dishonesty will be considered a serious breach of academic values.  You will be teaching undergraduate students about academic honesty, so it is especially important that you understand why honesty is important and how to avoid dishonesty.

## Students with Disabilities

Quoted from: [https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Prospective-Current-Students/Student-Life/Resources](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Prospective-Current-Students/Student-Life/Resources)

"A disability is any physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. A person is considered to be a person with a disability if he/she has the disability, has a record of the disability, or is regarded as having the disability. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, qualified persons with disabilities are entitled to reasonable accommodations to achieve non-discriminatory access to programs, services, and activities of the GC. Some examples of covered disabilities are visual and hearing impairments, mobility impairments, impairment of hand function, and such “hidden” disabilities as AIDS/HIV, learning disabilities, ADD and ADHD, heart conditions, chronic fatigue syndrome, and being in recovery from substance abuse. The Graduate Center does not discriminate on the basis of disability in the admission and retention of students. To ensure equal access for persons with disabilities to all academic and other programs, services, and activities of the GC, as required by law, appropriate accommodations will be made. These may include auxiliary aids and services for students with visual impairments (readers/library assistants and such technology as adaptive computer software and hardware, etc.); qualified sign-language interpreters; scribes; extended or divided time on examinations for students with learning disabilities or reduced physical stamina; adjustments in course load when appropriate; voice-recognition software; use of a computer for exams; and taping classes.

"Adaptive equipment and computer software are available at the Graduate Center. Computer users have access to screen-character enlargement, text-to-speech, and optical-character-recognition scan-and-read software, a closed-circuit television and voice-recognition software. For students with hearing impairments, the Graduate Center has available a personal FM listening system (for use on an individual basis for classes and meetings). The auditoriums are equipped with infrared equipment to assist those with hearing impairments. Contact Ms. Lerner or Miss Perram in Student Affairs to request accommodation and for additional information about facilities and services available to students with disabilities.

"The Mina Rees Library can provide students with disabilities with such services as staff assistance in catalog searches and location of books and journals.

Students with disabilities should register with Security and Public Safety (Room 9117; Telephone:1-212-817-7761) so that provision may be made for their safety should an emergency arise.

"Users of TDD (Telecommunications Devices for the Deaf) within New York state should call the Telecommunications Service at 711 or at 1-800-662-1220. Users of TDD outside New York state should call their local Telecommunications Service.

"The Vice President for Student Affairs is the 504/ADA Coordinator (Room 7301; 817-7400). For more information (with confidentiality) contact Sharon Lerner or Elise Perram (212-817-7400 or disabilityservices@gc.cuny.edu) and consult the Graduate Center Student Handbook."
